### âœ… **Day 27: Big Data & Data Warehousing Concepts**  
Today, youâ€™ll learn about **Big Data** and **Data Warehousing**, including the differences between **OLAP** and **OLTP** systems. Youâ€™ll also get an introduction to popular data warehousing solutions like **Snowflake**, **Amazon Redshift**, and **Google BigQuery**.

#### **1. OLTP vs OLAP**  

| Feature                | OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) | OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Handles day-to-day transactions      | Analyzes large volumes of historical data |
| **Data Structure**     | Normalized (e.g., relational tables) | Denormalized (e.g., star schema)     |
| **Query Type**         | Simple, frequent, short-lived       | Complex, infrequent, long-running    |
| **Performance**        | Optimized for fast writes           | Optimized for fast reads             |
| **Examples**           | E-commerce orders, banking systems  | Business intelligence, reporting     |

#### **2. Data Warehousing**  
A data warehouse is a centralized repository for storing and analyzing large volumes of data from multiple sources. It is optimized for querying and reporting.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Integration:** Combines data from multiple sources.  
- **Historical Data:** Stores large amounts of historical data.  
- **Performance:** Optimized for complex queries and aggregations.

#### **3. Snowflake**  
Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that separates storage and compute, allowing for flexible scaling.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Scalability:** Independent scaling of storage and compute.  
- **Performance:** Optimized for complex queries.  
- **Ease of Use:** Fully managed with minimal maintenance.  

**Example Query:**  
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Task:**  
- Explore Snowflakeâ€™s architecture and run a sample query.  

---

#### **4. Amazon Redshift**  
Amazon Redshift is a fully managed data warehouse service on AWS.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Columnar Storage:** Optimized for analytical queries.  
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with other AWS services.  
- **Performance:** Uses parallel processing for fast queries.  

**Example Query:**  
```sql
SELECT product_category, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM products
GROUP BY product_category;
```

**Task:**  
- Set up a Redshift cluster and run a sample query.  

---

#### **5. Google BigQuery**  
Google BigQuery is a serverless, highly scalable data warehouse on Google Cloud.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Serverless:** No infrastructure management required.  
- **Scalability:** Handles petabytes of data effortlessly.  
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Supports streaming data.  

**Example Query:**  
```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS login_count
FROM user_logins
GROUP BY user_id;
```

**Task:**  
- Create a BigQuery dataset and run a sample query.

### **Example Solutions**  

**1. OLTP vs OLAP Comparison:**  
| Feature                | OLTP                                | OLAP                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Day-to-day transactions             | Historical data analysis            |
| **Data Structure**     | Normalized                          | Denormalized                        |
| **Query Type**         | Simple, frequent                   | Complex, infrequent                 |

**2. Snowflake Query:**  
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**3. Amazon Redshift Query:**  
```sql
SELECT product_category, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM products
GROUP BY product_category;
```

**4. Google BigQuery Query:**  
```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS login_count
FROM user_logins
GROUP BY user_id;
```
