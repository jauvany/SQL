### âœ… **Day 24: Performance Debugging & Troubleshooting**  
Today, youâ€™ll learn how to identify and fix performance bottlenecks in your SQL queries. Youâ€™ll use tools like **indexes** and **EXPLAIN ANALYZE** to optimize slow queries and improve database performance.

---

#### **1. Identifying Bottlenecks**  
Performance bottlenecks can occur due to:  
- **Poorly written queries:** Lack of proper joins, subqueries, or aggregations.  
- **Missing indexes:** Queries scanning entire tables instead of using indexes.  
- **Resource contention:** High CPU, memory, or disk usage.  

**Symptoms of Slow Queries:**  
- Long execution times.  
- High resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O).  
- Timeouts or errors in applications.  

---

#### **2. Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE**  
The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command provides detailed information about how a query is executed, including execution time, cost, and resource usage.  

**Syntax:**  
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT ...;
```

**Example:**  
Analyze a query that retrieves orders with customer details.  

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT o.order_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_date, o.total_amount, o.status
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

**Key Metrics to Look For:**  
- **Execution Time:** Total time taken to execute the query.  
- **Cost:** Estimated cost of the query (lower is better).  
- **Rows:** Number of rows scanned or returned.  
- **Index Usage:** Whether indexes are being used effectively.  

**Task:**  
- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to analyze a slow query in your database.  

---

#### **3. Fixing Slow Queries with Indexes**  
Indexes are critical for improving query performance. They allow the database to quickly locate rows without scanning the entire table.  

**Common Index Types:**  
- **Single-Column Index:** Index on one column.  
- **Composite Index:** Index on multiple columns.  
- **Unique Index:** Ensures all values in the indexed column(s) are unique.  

**Example:**  
Create an index on the `customer_id` column in the `orders` table.  

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
```

**Task:**  
- Identify a query that scans the entire table and create an index to optimize it.  

---

#### **4. Optimizing Queries**  

**Example 1: Optimize a Join Query**  
Before Optimization:  
```sql
SELECT o.order_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_date, o.total_amount, o.status
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

After Optimization:  
- Ensure indexes exist on `orders(customer_id)` and `customers(customer_id)`.  
- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to verify performance improvements.  

**Example 2: Optimize a Subquery**  
Before Optimization:  
```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE product_id IN (SELECT product_id FROM order_items WHERE order_id = 1);
```

After Optimization:  
- Use a join instead of a subquery.  
```sql
SELECT p.product_name, p.price
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
WHERE oi.order_id = 1;
```

**Task:**  
- Rewrite a slow query using joins or other optimization techniques.

### **Practice Queries**  
1. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to analyze a slow query.  
2. Create an index to optimize a query that scans the entire table.  
3. Rewrite a slow query using joins or other optimization techniques.  

---

### **Example Solutions**  

**1. Analyze a Slow Query:**  
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT o.order_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_date, o.total_amount, o.status
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

**2. Create an Index:**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
```

**3. Optimize a Query:**  
Before Optimization:  
```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE product_id IN (SELECT product_id FROM order_items WHERE order_id = 1);
```

After Optimization:  
```sql
SELECT p.product_name, p.price
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
WHERE oi.order_id = 1;
```
